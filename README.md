# ArcSearch
A tool that allows a user to evaluate over a list of structured JSON files representing game playtraces searching for a specific gameplay "Arc" that best matches a drawing they provide the system.

# TODOS:
- Add prompt records to folder.
- Polish up user front-end - div sizing, formatting on form, labels/controls
- Add running instructions to this README
- Add sample JSON format to the repo
- Keep testing Frechet/DTW fitting
- Test larger file sizes (1000+ files)
- Total similarity score (what is the similarity across all samples)

# Acknowledgement

Initial development on this tooling was done in collaboration with a LLM - Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. A full list of prompts can be found in the "Prompts" folder.
